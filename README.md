# ReversiblePipeline

This is a Matlab implementation of a pre-learned image 
processing model. A description of the model can be found in
"A New In-Camera Imaging Model for Color Computer Vision 
and its Application" by Seon Joo Kim, Hai Ting Lin, 
Michael Brown, et al. Code for learning a new model can 
be found at the original project page. This particular 
implementation was written by Mark Buckler.
