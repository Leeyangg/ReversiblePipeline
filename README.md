# ReversiblePipeline

This is an implementation of a pre-learned camera image
processing model. A description of the model can be found in
"A New In-Camera Imaging Model for Color Computer Vision 
and its Application" by Seon Joo Kim, Hai Ting Lin, Zheng Lu,
Sabine Susstrunk, Stephen Lin, and Michael S. Brown. Code for
learning a new model can be found at the original project 
page. This particular implementation was written by 
Mark Buckler.
